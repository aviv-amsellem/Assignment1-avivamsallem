			<h3>
			My name is Saul Hudson, and I’m from Los-Angeles, California.<br>
			I’m a musician and a psalmist, but I’m mostly known for my guitar skills and the band I’m a part of – "Guns N’ Roses".<br>
			If you don’t know until now who I am, you will probably recognize by my nickname “Slash”. <br><br>
			So here what there is to know about me.<br>
			I born in Hampstead, England and right now I’m 54 years old. Since the age 15, when my grandmother gave my first guitar,  me and the guitar was always a<br>
			successful love story and most of the time you’ll probably find me with a guitar in my hands.<br><br>
			After I few years when I got my first guitar and made improvements with my guitar skills, I had a dream to join a band and become famous!<br>
			At first, it wasn’t easy at all, I formed a few bands with a childhood friend but those bands have not been successful and recognized.<br>
			In the end, after a few failing attempts, I joined the band “Guns N’ Roses” and together we began to conquer and music world, and especially the hard-rock genre!<br><br>
			For me, the thing I’m mostly happy about is that the in songs we made, my guitar playing made a lot of inspiration in fans around the world, and it inspired them to study<br>
			how to play a guitar and to dare making their dreams come true!<br><br>
			In time, I got some nice rewards for my skills. Here some of them:<br><br>
			<li>In 2004, the magazine “Guitar World” placed my riff (opening guitar) in the song “Sweet Child o’Mine” at the 1st place on their list of “The 100 Greatest Riffs”.</li><br>
			<li>In 2008, ‘Guitar World’ ranked my solo in the song “November Rain” at 6th on their list of “The 100 Greatest Guitar Solos”.</li><br>
			<li>In 2009, Time magazine names me as one of “The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players”.</li>
